This is where I express myself through a blend of code and words.

## Code

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000][app] with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`][font-optimization] to automatically optimize and
load Ysabeau, a custom Google Font.

[app]: http://localhost:3000
[font-optimization]: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization
